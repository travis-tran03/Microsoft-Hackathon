													Programs in social science focus on how individuals behave within society, how society works and the relationship between them.","https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/explore-careers/majors/social-sciences","Major: Social Work","https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/explore-careers/majors/social-sciences/social-work","As a social worker, you’ll advocate for change in ways that enhance people’s quality of life. Organizations were started in the 1800s in response to growing immigration, poverty, and urbanization issues. As social work initiatives increased, so did the demand for training. In 1898, Columbia University provided the first social work class. Then, in 1904, Simmons College and Harvard University collaborated to form the Boston School for Social Workers. Other schools, such as the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, started in 1908.

No matter where you study, what demographic you choose to work with, or whether you choose a clinical or nonclinical organization, you’ll have a profound impact. That’s because you’ll be the voice for those often marginalized in society. You’ll address social injustices and help individuals and families navigate issues. 

Social work is a challenging career that focuses on the multifaceted problems people face within themselves and their environment. But helping people find the resources and ways to cope so that they lead fuller, healthier lives is a fulfilling part of the job. 

What does a student majoring in Social Work study? 

To help people improve their lives, a social work major will learn about human behavior and the social challenges people face. Your coursework and fieldwork will prepare you to have the knowledge and practical experience to advocate and problem solve for a diverse group of people. Here are some courses you may encounter when researching this academic track: 

Introduction to Social Work
	General Biology
	Social Welfare
	Public Health 
	Human Behavior
	Social Research
What can I do with a Social Work degree?

The type of social work clients you’ll work with depends on the sector you choose to work in: government agencies, health care, nonprofits, or schools. You can work with an age-specific group, such as older adults, or with a mix of ages from young to old. Either way, social work offers diversity in not only where you can work but also with whom. Career opportunities abound in this field. Here’s a sampling:

Child, Family, and School Social Workers
	Community Health Workers
	Recreation Workers
	Social and Community Service Managers
	Social and Human Service Assistants
Specializations for a Social Work Major:

Substance Abuse Treatment
	Human Rights and Social Justice
	Community Organization
	Program Development
	Leadership and Supervision
	Policy Practice
What are the requirements for a Social Work degree? 

To earn a degree in social work and prepare yourself for a career, you’d be wise to build a solid foundation of both courses and practical field experience. Social work programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education will outline the requirements to ensure you’re adequately equipped to start a career and, if you choose, begin a master’s degree in social work."

But while many passed the time baking bread or sharing TikTok videos of failed sourdough starters, others struggled. 

And a bevy of issues quickly inundated millions during the pandemic, resulting in a surge of mental health and substance abuse issues. In 2020, the American Psychological Association surveyed adults in the U.S. Two-thirds of the survey respondents reported an increase in pandemic-related stress. Pursuing a degree in psychology prepares you to help people cope with the harmful effects of the pandemic. But a degree in this field offers careers far beyond healthcare.

What does a student majoring in Psychology study? 

Examples of psychology occur in everyday situations:  A recent widower refuses to engage in activities they once enjoyed. A patient with a brain injury starts to act aggressively toward others. A company makes significant internal changes that result in high employee dissatisfaction and turnover. There’s a long line outside a retail shop and the promotional sign that says, “Limited Stock.”

These examples showcase the numerous ways in which psychology plays a role in our lives. Understanding the human mind and behavior—the way people think, feel, and act—underscores what one studies in the field of psychology. 

As a psychology major, you’ll take courses such as these:

Biological Psychology
	Behavioral Neuroscience
	Cognitive Psychology 
	Developmental Psychology
	Human Development
	Research Methodology
	Statistics
What can I do with a Psychology degree?

The opportunities are vast for careers in psychology:

A clinical psychologist can help with depressive signs of grief. Biopsychologists research the impact of brain damage, and neuropsychologists provide comprehensive, tailored treatments for brain injury patients.

But the work one can do in psychology isn’t limited to clinical settings alone. An industrial and organizational psychologist analyzes an organization’s issues and proposes solutions. And what about that long line of customers queuing outside a retail store? That’s the contribution of a consumer psychologist applying the scarcity principle: FOMO. Sound familiar?

Here are some careers opportunities to explore:

Health and Safety Engineers
	Social and Human Service Assistants
	Child, Family, and School Social Workers
	Social Science Research Assistants
	Training and Development Managers
Specializations for a Psychology Major:

Addiction Psychology
	Cultural Psychology
	Environmental Psychology
	Psychology of Aging 
	Human Services Psychology
What are the requirements for a Psychology degree? 

Besides meeting the core requirements each semester, set your sights on completing an internship. Also, with the guidance of a faculty adviser, conduct research and submit the findings in a bachelor thesis. You’ll gain practical experience while strengthening your analytical skills."

If you choose this major, you’ll learn the principles at work behind the decisions that affect every aspect of our lives.

Whether they're conservative or liberal, cynical or idealistic, one common characteristic among political science and government majors is their addiction to politics. If active engagement in the political system is for you, a political science major is a great way to get started. 

Political science and government majors study the systems people set up to organize their societies, from neighborhoods to nations.

“I took a required class [during] winter session called War and Peace. It was challenging because it was broadly based on conflicts in different societies, [such as the war between] the Croats and Serbs.”Lakethia, junior, political science, San Jose State University

Yet, since all humans are, after all, human, every language also contains universal linguistic elements.

Linguistics majors study how languages like Spanish, French, Korean, Hopi -- and even computer programming languages -- function and how people learn to speak and write in those languages.

Linguistics deals with the structure of language (including syntax, phonetics, and grammar), the relationships between languages, and the way languages change over time.

“I just really like language. I enjoy every aspect of it, be it reading or writing poetry, essays, and plays, or studying parts of speech and grammar.”Jon, senior, linguistics and English, University of Michigan

Are You Ready To...?

Record people speaking in order to study the way they use parts of speech
	Perhaps study in another country for a semester or a summer
	Diagram sentences written in unfamiliar languages
	Translate a computer programming language
It Helps To Be...

Interested in the way language works. If you like to look up the origins of words, guess where people are from by the way they speak, and play word games, this could be the major for you.

College Checklist

	Is there a linguistics department, or is linguistics part of another department, such as anthropology?
	How easy is it to double major?
	Does the college have a linguistics lab?
	Does the program offer a study-abroad program in which students can immerse themselves in a foreign language?
	Will you be able to do independent research?
Did You Know?

Many of the more than five thousand languages spoken in the world today may be extinct by the end of the century.

Course Spotlight

In an introductory linguistics course, you’ll get a taste of how diverse this major can be. One topic covered in class will be the ethnic and regional variations in speech. The professor might even ask you and your classmates to demonstrate. Other topics include the neurology of speech and the way people learn language in the first place. And don’t be surprised if you’re asked to analyze a sample of writing in a language you’ve never seen before."

If you are truly passionate about learning and want to spend your college years exploring new ideas rather than preparing for a specific career, you might consider majoring in liberal arts and sciences.

Most liberal arts courses include a great deal of reading, writing, and discussion, and classes tend to be small. You’ll gain the ability to reason critically, communicate effectively, and understand relationships across broad fields of knowledge.

Students of liberal arts and sciences often design their own program of study. They take courses in the arts, the biological and physical sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities.

Did You Know?

Choosing this major is one way to prepare for a world in which new and unexpected careers are invented every day.

Did You Know?

The liberal arts and sciences program is typically offered only as an undergraduate major.

Course Spotlight

After taking the required courses, many liberal arts and sciences students work with a professor to design an independent study program in which they can blend their many interests. A student might propose a reading list and schedule of assignments, to be approved by the instructor. This opportunity to do self-directed research provides exactly the kind of freedom that most liberal arts and sciences majors relish. The final project is usually a long paper based on the student’s work during the term."

This law made it easier for the government to guard against terrorist activity by allowing such tactics as search without notice. But many believe that the law endangers the civil rights of Americans and immigrants.

Do you think it makes sense to trade in some civil rights for greater protection against terrorism? Do you believe that the government's greater access to our private lives will make us safer? If you major in legal studies, you'll get a chance to examine all perspectives on important matters like these.

This major focuses on law and legal issues from the perspectives of the social sciences and humanities.

Were people and ideas all that different? How did the good old days become today?

To answer questions like these, you’ll need to look for clues -- and not only in textbooks filled with dates and biographies. As a history major, you’ll find history in everything from a 1956 Elvis Presley poster to a 1934 ticket stub showing the price of a movie. You’ll even find it in last summer’s playlist of your favorite songs.

By the time you graduate, you’ll know how to decide for yourself what to think about the old days -- good or bad. And, perhaps more importantly, you’ll learn what those days can teach us about today and tomorrow.

History majors learn how to interpret objects and written documents from the past. They also read the works of published historians and evaluate their ideas.

“By mastering history you become a well-rounded person with a better understanding of cultures and trends.”Zach, sophomore, French, history, and journalism, Northwestern University

The two may even use similar techniques and treat similar types of clients.

But historically, clinical psychologists were more likely to work with people who had a mental illness. Counseling psychologists concentrated on people who weren't sick but who needed help developing their careers. Over time, counseling psychologists have added to their services -- they now help people reach all sorts of goals, not just finding the right job.

Students in this major learn how to provide psychological counseling to people one-on-one and in groups. Courses include such topics as patient/counselor relationships, group therapy, child and adolescent therapy, and marital and family therapy.

Most psychology programs require a research project. This can serve you well if you want to become a counseling psychologist, since most grad programs look for applicants with backgrounds in both counseling and research. Even if you don't continue on this path, the skills you gain as you plan, run, and write up your own experiment will serve you in any career you pursue.

Today, as much as ever, we are fascinated by questions about crime: Why do people commit crimes? Is there such a thing as a born killer? Is a completely crime-free society possible? 

Criminology is the search for answers to questions like these. Our understanding of who commits crimes and why has a direct influence on the criminal-justice system. As a criminology student, you may come up with new theories that lead to better responses to crime and its causes.

Students of criminology study the nature and causes of crime, the behavior of criminals, and the criminal-justice system.

Some marketing programs require that you build a portfolio. A portfolio is a detailed collection of your school projects and experiences. In addition to a resume and cover letter, you can include everything from mock business plans to mock advertising campaigns.

Finance majors learn how to make financial decisions for organizations. Course work covers such topics as planning, raising funds, making wise investments, and controlling costs.

Get ready for a tough schedule of technique and choreography classes, long evenings in rehearsal, and academic classes. Dance majors challenge their bodies and their minds in this demanding art form.

Both the bachelor of fine arts (B.F.A.) and the bachelor of arts (B.A.) prepare students for careers as dancers and choreographers. The B.A. also prepares students for careers in dance education, administration, and therapy.

Students of dance learn to express ideas and emotions through dance forms such as ballet, modern, jazz, ethnic, and folk dance. Classes cover such topics as dance technique, choreography, and the history of dance.

“There is so much more to dancing than just dancing ... I feel as though I knew about one-tenth of what I needed to know about dance before I came to college.”Alecia, sophomore, dance and premed, University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point

Throughout your study of dance, you’ll learn about different systems of dance notation, or ways of describing human movement through written symbols and abbreviations. You are sure to encounter labanotation, a notation system that uses symbols to represent the exact positions of each body part. Labanotation can describe any human movement, from large patterns that move the dancer across the floor to the smallest hand gesture."

When you read a novel, do you think about how the author created characters you can relate to?

If you study creative writing, you’ll try to answer questions like these, analyzing poetry and fiction to learn how writers create successful work. And, of course, you’ll try your hand at creating your own work, which you’ll share with professors and classmates. Although it’s very unlikely that you’ll make a living from writing poetry or fiction, you will gain the skills needed to work in fields such as editing, publishing, journalism, and advertising.

Students of creative writing focus on the construction of poetry and prose. They read and analyze the work of established writers and write original creative work.

“The writing process teaches you discipline and strength. It ‘toughens’ you in the best sense of the word, allowing you to recognize the possibilities in yourself and the world around you.” Jonathan Fink, Creative Writing Fellow in Poetry, Emory University

Are You Ready To...?

Give readings of your work in public
	Work on the staff of the school literary magazine
	Revise your work in response to comments from others
	Accept criticism of your work graciously
	Share your creative work with professors and classmates
	Keep to a schedule for completing writing assignments
	Study the history of various literary genres
	Read contemporary writers
	Complete a collection of poems, stories, or essays as a senior project
	Attend the readings of classmates and visiting writers
It Helps To Be...

Open to experiencing a wide range of texts and up for analyzing the writing of others. You should also have independent work habits and strong writing and speaking skills.

College Checklist

	Are there professors who don't teach, or who only teach grad students?
	What is the average class size?
	Does the university invite visiting writers to read on campus?

“You stay up all night because you get into [the writing]; you want to find out how to express an idea and make it real ... That's part of the joy of it. --” Dorothy, creative writing, San Francisco State University

Course Spotlight

As you advance in your studies, you'll have the chance to take a writing workshop in either fiction or poetry. In this course, you’ll critique the work of your classmates and receive comments on your own creative pieces. This process can be difficult to get used to, but it’s meant to help you improve your writing.

You’ll probably have to revise your work, taking the advice of your professor and your classmates into account, and hand in a final draft."
